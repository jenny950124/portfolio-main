Project Description:
This portfolio site includes multiple pages like Home, About, and Projects, and demonstrates my proficiency in React.js. The site makes use of the following key features:

1. React Router for smooth page navigation without reloading.

2. useState() and useEffect() hooks for managing state and side effects.

3.  responsive design, ensuring the site looks great on all screen sizes.

4. Images, project cards, and bio sections to showcase my work and experience.

Features:
Home Page: Welcome page with cloud animation, project overview, and button to navigate to the About page.

About Page: Includes a short bio and image, fetching data with useState() and useEffect().

Projects Page: Displays a collection of my work in a grid layout.

Responsive Design: Layout adapts to different screen sizes using media queries.

Installation Instructions:
Clone the repository to your local machine:
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/portfolio.git

Navigate into the project directory:
cd portfolio

Install dependencies using npm:
node install
npm install

Start the development server:
npm run dev

Usage:
Once the app is running, you can navigate between pages like Home, About, and Projects using the navigation bar. The "Learn More About Me" button on the Home page will take you to the About page. The About page loads dynamic data after a short delay using React hooks (useState() and useEffect()).

Technologies Used:
1. React.js: JavaScript library for building user interfaces.

2. React Router: For routing and navigation between pages without full-page reloads.

3. useState(): To manage the state of the application (e.g., counter, bio data).

4. useEffect(): To handle side effects, such as fetching data or managing lifecycle events.

5. CSS: For styling the website and making it responsive with media queries.

6. Vite.js: Modern build tool that provides fast and optimized development.

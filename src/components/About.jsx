          <p>
            I built this site to reflect who I am, both as a person and as a designer. The bold red? Thatâ€™s my passion and drive. The soft pink? Thatâ€™s my approachability and joy. Together, they represent the balance I bring into every project: confident, but never cold. Friendly, but always intentional.
          </p>

          <p>
            Before I stepped into design, I studied nursing and this path that taught me how to listen deeply, care intentionally, and see people beyond the surface.  
            That experience still shapes how I approach design today: with empathy, precision, and a desire to solve real problems for real people.
          </p>

          <p>
            I donâ€™t just design, I code too. My background in front-end development means I can bring ideas to life and collaborate closely with dev teams.  
            I see design and code not as separate lanes, but as a single bridge and I love walking both sides.

          <p>
            Throughout this portfolio, youâ€™ll notice movement, play, and interactivity. Itâ€™s not just for show, itâ€™s how I like to work: curious, energetic, and always experimenting.
          </p>

            Thanks for stopping by. If youâ€™re a potential collaborator, employer, or fellow creative, Iâ€™d love to connect. And yes, if you send a message, a tiny animated girl named Mei will sprint across the screen to deliver it.  
            Because design should delight. And every detail matters.

              <p>I built this site to reflect who I am, both as a person and as a designer. The bold red? That‚Äôs my passion and drive. The soft pink? That‚Äôs my approachability and joy. Together, they represent the balance I bring into every project: confident, but never cold. Friendly, but always intentional.</p>
              <p>Before I stepped into design, I studied nursing and this path that taught me how to listen deeply, care intentionally, and see people beyond the surface. That experience still shapes how I approach design today: with empathy, precision, and a desire to solve real problems for real people.</p>
              <p>I don‚Äôt just design, I code too. My background in front-end development means I can bring ideas to life and collaborate closely with dev teams. I see design and code not as separate lanes, but as a single bridge and I love walking both sides.</p>
              <p>Throughout this portfolio, you‚Äôll notice movement, play, and interactivity. It‚Äôs not just for show, it‚Äôs how I like to work: curious, energetic, and always experimenting.</p>
              <p>Thanks for stopping by. If you‚Äôre a potential collaborator, employer, or fellow creative, I‚Äôd love to connect. And yes, if you send a message, a tiny animated girl named Mei will sprint across the screen to deliver it. Because design should delight. And every detail matters.</p>
